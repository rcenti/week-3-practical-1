    <h1>Exercise 1.1</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The goal of this exercise is to familiarise yourself with using the browser console to identify bugs 
                and errors in your code.
            </p>
            <p>The code in <strong>exercise1-1/sketch.js</strong> is <em>supposed</em> to produce the output shown in 
                the video below. Run the code in your browser and you will see that it does not! The sketch stops after only one circle is drawn.</p>
            <p>The code contains two bugs--one is an error that causes the program to crash and the other is a logic mistake 
                that does not cause a crash but also does not produce the right output.
            </p>
            <p>When your code appears to crash (e.g. no shapes are drawn even though the code is present), open the browser console 
                by going to the View menu (in Chrome), selecting Developer, then choosing JavaScript Console. If there is an 
                error message, it will help you identify what and where the problem is.
            </p>
            <p>Fix the error in the code by opening the Console and reading the error message. To the right of the code, you should see 
                a message that says "sketch.js:" followed by a number. This tells you that the error occurred in your sketch.js file 
                and the number tells you the line number that the error is likely on. Use this information to help you 
                fix the error.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the error is fixed, you will see that only one row of circles is drawn. There is no error message this time 
                but the code is misbehaving. This suggests a logic error, likely with one of the variables used to position 
                the circles. Try using the p5.js <code>print()</code> function or JavaScript's <code>console.log()</code> to print 
                the values of <code>circleX</code> and <code>circleY</code> at the end of <code>draw()</code>. You will need to 
                work out what <code>circleX</code> and <code>circleY</code> should be as the sketch progresses in order to make 
                use of the messages printed to the console.
            </p>
            <p>The bug is very small and you shouldn't need to make big changes to the code!</p>

                    <p>The error that causes the program to crash is a typo in a variable name. The variable name and line number 
                        are given in the error message.
                    </p>
                    <p>The logic error is harder to identify. Here is what to look for when you print the values 
                        of <code>circleX</code> and <code>circleY</code>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>circleX</code> should start at half the width of the circle and increase by the width of the circle until the circles reach the right edge. Then, because of the % operator, 
                        <code>circleX</code> should return to its original value before increasing again as before.</li>
                        <li><code>circleY</code> should start at half the width of the circle and stay the same until the circles reach the right edge of the screen. At this point, 
                        <code>circleY</code> should increase by the width of the circle, starting a new row. This pattern should continue until the circles reach the bottom edge. 
                        Then, <code>circleY</code> should return to its original value.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The error is caused by the order of operations in a calculation (think BODMAS or PEMDAS!). The modulo operator has the 
                        same precedence as multiplication or division.
